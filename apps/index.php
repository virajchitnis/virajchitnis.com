You can then go about logging your expenses within each 'Pocket'. The expenses will be organized by day and at the bottom of each day you will be able to view the amount spent during that day and the amount remaining (balance carried forward).<br>Finally, once your trip is over, or your project is complete, you can generate an email with your expenses and send it to your accountant or to yourself to keep it in record.<br><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id905751695"><img src="../images/app_store_140px.png" width="140"></a></p>
